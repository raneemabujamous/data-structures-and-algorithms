## Approach & Efficiency :

understood the problem first
I imagined how the results should be
I made a drawings of how the linked list would be after insertion of multiple nodes Linked-List.
I wrote the code
I made the tests

## API

append(): appends an new node with given value to the end of the list.
insertBefore(): adds a new node with give value before specified value node.
insertAfter(): adds a new node with give value after specified value node.
